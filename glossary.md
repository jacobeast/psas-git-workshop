<a name="clone"></a>clone: Copying a remote repository to your local computer for the first time is cloning. Git creates a new, empty repository, copies the history from the remote (that remote becomes origin), then checks out the latest commit (by default, branch master) to your working tree.

<a name="commit"></a>commit: a snapshot of all the files in a [repository](#repository) at a particular time. The commit also includes a timestamp, the author, and the committer.

<a name="github"></a>GitHub: The place where all our repositories live. The place where everybody goes to get the latest-and-greatest copy of whatever it is they're looking for. Social networking meets version control. Not just a provider of homes for homeless Git repositories, but also issue tracking, wikis, and much more.

<a name="index"></a>index: A transient space used to mark which changes in the working tree will become part of the next commit.

<a name="master"></a>master: The default branch name.

<a name="origin"></a>origin: The [remote](#remote) repository from which this repository was originally [clone](#clone)d. [Push](#push) and [pull](#pull) operate on origin unless another remote is specified instead.

<a name="push"></a>push:

<a name="pull"></a>pull:

<a name="remote"></a>remote: A copy of this repository somewhere else. Changes are shared with others by [push](#push)ing or [pull](#pull)ing to/from other remotes, which copies local history to the remote (push) or the remote's history to the local repository (pull).

<a name="repository"></a>repository: A collection of files, usually all part of a single work, that are tracked and versioned together.

<a name="stage"></a>stage: An old name for what is now known as the index. See [index](#index).
